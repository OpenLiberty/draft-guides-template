= Creating a REST API for a todo list application

// Start the introduction with "You'll explore how to..." or something similarly catchy:
Learn how to create a todo list API as a REST service using JAX-RS, CDI, and Open Liberty.
// Write no more than two sentences, or about fifty words with meaningful information on what the user can accomplish with this guide.
// Do not start the introduction with "This guide...".

// See the REST guide at as an exemplar guide.
// https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html
// https://github.com/OpenLiberty/guide-rest-intro


== What you'll learn
// Write about what the user will learn in a meaningful intro paragraph.
// Follow the intro paragraph with more details of what the user will learn, but still keep it brief compared to the overall guide.

// You'll next add the various sections that are needed for a particular guide.
* Learn to use JAX-RS and CDI
* Learn how to build a REST service for a todo list application


// Add this getting started section to your guide if it is applicable. Use the following include to pull in the git clone instructions from the guides-common repo.
== Getting started

include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]

// This is a subsection of the "Getting started" section above. It should briefly walk the user through
// how to setup everything in the "finish" directory and try out the finished version of what
// they will be building.
//=== Try what youâ€™ll build

include::{common-includes}/trywhatyoubuild-intro.adoc[]

* Brief explanation on how to use the finished application and what you should expect to see

// Describe what user expects to see after running the complete version of the application.

include::{common-includes}/trywhatyoubuild-end.adoc[]

//Write a sentence with the context like "Navigate to the `start` directory to begin." in the section where user starts working with the implementation.

//Write a sentence with the context like "Now, navigate to the `start` directory to begin." in the section where user starts working with the implementation.

// == Section title for this section, starting with a gerund like Creating, Building, etc
// Read the wiki for the general rules of thumb to help you with formatting these next few sections:
// https://github.com/OpenLiberty/guides-common/wiki/Rules-of-thumb-for-formatting

// Start each additional section title with a meaningful gerund such as Creating, Building, Testing, Configuring, or Administering.
// Follow the gerund with a meaningful noun phrase. For example: Creating a JAX-RS application
// Have as many sections and section titles as needed.

// What to add for each section:
// We'll be writing these sections by following a flow similar to technical blog posts or college textbooks so that the user thinks about the content.
// Start each section with a meaningful description about what the user is doing in the section.
// Include code snippets.
// Avoid making all the documentation a series of steps and tasks, bullets, or numbered lists.
// Use tick marks around directories, files, values, class names, method names, and so on.
// Example: `this-is-a-file`, `this/is/a/path`, `thisIsAMethod`.

== Building the model

* Navigate to the `start` directory
* Represent an entry in a todo list

Create the todo model class in the `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todo/models/TodoModel.java` file:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todo/models/TodoModel.java[tags=**;!copyright;]
----

* Getters, setters, and default constructor such that the model can be serialized/deserialized easily

== Creating the service

* Create a service that is injected into the JAX-RS resource

Create the todo service interface in the `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todo/services/TodoService.java` file:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todo/services/TodoService.java[tags=**;!copyright;]
----


Next, create the sample todo service class in the `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todo/services/samples/SampleTodoService.java` file:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todo/services/samples/SampleTodoService.java[tags=**;!copyright;]
----


* Implemented basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations.
* Service is ApplicationScoped, which essentially means that it is a singleton.


== Creating the JAX-RS resource

* Description of the technology, possibly with a link to learn more: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/restful/restful_jax_rs.htm
* Use CDI to inject the todo service into the resource

Create the todo resource class in the `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todo/resources/TodoResource.java` file:


[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todo/resources/TodoResource.java[tags=**;!copyright;]
----


* The resource methods are accessible via HTTP
* Use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs to handle reading, creating, updating, and deleting resources respectively
* Validate data models and send appropriate response accordingly


// Add this section to your guide if it is applicable.
// Put this section in the appropriate order in your guide.
== Building and running the application

* Instructions to build the application
* Instructions to start/stop the server

// Use the following include to pull in the Maven build instructions from the guides-common repo.
include::{common-includes}/mvnbuild.adoc[]

// In between here, you should state where you application can be found now that its running (ie. what urls)
* Sample usage of the application
* Suggestions for what changes the reader can make to explore the code

// Use the following include to pull in the Liberty start/stop server instructions from the guides-common repo.
include::{common-includes}/mvnpackage.adoc[]

* Instructions to rebuild the application

// Include this section if appropriate
== Running the tests

Create the todo test class in the `finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/todo/TodoTest.java` file:


[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/todo/TodoTest.java[tags=**;!copyright;]
----

* Test makes a request to an endpoint and checks that it has an OK status
* Test uses JUnit

// Include this for info on how to run the tests
include::{common-includes}/mvnverify.adoc[]

// Including a listing block with test results here
* Show console output of the test results

// OPTIONAL: after listing the test results, mention a simple change a user can make/introduce that
// will cause the tests to fail. Be brief and don't give the users all of the instructions. At this
// point, they should be comfortable enough to figure it out on their own.
* Introduce a simple change that can be made to make the tests fail, for example check that the status for this test is 400


== Great work! You're done!

* Summary of content taught in the guide

// Briefly summarize what the user achieved in this guide (1-2 sentences).

// OPTIONAL: briefly state what the user could do next now that they've learned the technologies in this guide.

// Include the below from the guides-common repo to tell users how they can contribute to the guide
include::{common-includes}/finish.adoc[]

// DO NO CREATE ANYMORE SECTIONS AT THIS POINT
// Related guides will be added in automatically here if you included them in ":page-related-guides"
